# ModularQA
ModularQA is a QA system that answers complex multi-hop and discrete reasoning questions by decomposing them into sub-questions answerable by two sub-models: a neural factoid single-span QA model and a symbolic calculator. These sub-questions and answers provided by the sub-model provide a natural language explanation of the
modelâ€™s reasoning. This system is designed and trained based on the Text Modular Networks framework where the decompositions are generated in the language of the sub-models without needing annotated decompositions. For more details, refer to the [paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e1d82d24d58433ce9e211551605a0bfd296624f).
